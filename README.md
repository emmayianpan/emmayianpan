### Hello :speak_no_evil:

My name is Emma! I was born and raised in Taiwan and currently live in Asbury Park, NJ.
<br>
I am passionate at handling/analyzing data and worked in the hotel industry before. I am still fresh to the coding world but I learn new things everyday (and feel like I am a pro while solving debugs hehe). Looking forward to persuing a career on data analysis field.
<br>
I love traveling, cooking and googling anything I do not know (including my cooking recipe).
<br>
Hope everyone who's browsing the website enjoys and please do not hesitate to shoot me an email if you have any thought! _special_
